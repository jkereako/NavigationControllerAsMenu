# NavigationControllerAsMenu
This is a familiar and simple way to implement slide-out menu using a navigation
controller.

# Behavior
When the app is first loaded, home screen is immediately pushed on to the
navigation stack without animation. It appears to the user that the home screen
is the first view on the navigation stack when, in fact, it's the second. The
back button then becomes a more familiar menu button and the first view of the
navigation stack is the menu.

It's a neat trick which does not require any unfamiliar or difficult to
understand code.
